        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
           Our mission is simple: To help local, independent bookstores thrive in the age of ecommerce.<br><br>
           <b>Certified as a B Corp</b>, Bookshop.org puts this mission and the public good above financial interests, giving over 80% of our 
           profit margin to independent bookstores. In 2022, B-Labs announced we were "best for the world": in the top 5% of all B-Corps.<br><br>
           It is written in our governance documents that we will never sell the company to Amazon or any major U.S. retailer.<br><br>
           As a Climate Neutral company, we are committed to operating sustainably.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            ABC Bookstore began as an idea to help support bookstores and their communities as more and more people are buying their books online.
            We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon for socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all books in
            the US and is growing. That shift threatens the future of bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, and publishers who rely on a 
            diverse, healthy ecosystem for books.<b> We had a better idea â€” give readers the convenience of online shopping while supporting 
            independent bookstores at the same time.</b><br><br>
        </p>
        <h2> vision</h2>
        <p>
            World where everyone has access to books that will enrich, improve and change their lives.
